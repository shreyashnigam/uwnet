        "1. Write a new data loader which picks a random point in the text to start from and returns 10 consecutive sequences starting from that point onward. \n",
        "    - You should also modify the train and test functions to reset the memory when you reset the sequence.\n",
        "    - You should consider an epoch to be feeding in approximately the number of characters in the dataset.\n",
